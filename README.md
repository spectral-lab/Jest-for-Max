> Utility library which helps Test Driven Development in Cycling '74 Max

## What is TDD?
  See [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)
## Why TDD is important?
  The importance of TDD cannot be overemphasized.  
  TDD means fewer bugs, higher quality software, and a razor focus, but it can slow development down and the test suites can be tedious to manage and maintain.  
  All in all, it is a recommended approach as the Pros far outweighs the Cons.
